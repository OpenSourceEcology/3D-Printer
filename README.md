# 3D-Printer

See https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/D3D

Download the folder of Files in Arduino language for OSE's 3D printer - by clicking the green button labeled Clone or Download, then download the zip. 

Open Arduino IDE 1.6.8 and open OSE_Marlin.ino file in the folder - that is the firmware for the 3D printer controller board.

Versions:

1. D3D v18.07 Marlin - 0.4 mm nozzle, Prusa i3 MK2 Extruder
2. Marlin - This is the version for a 0.6 mm nozzle, E3D Titan Aero extruder.
3. Former versions of OSE Marlin are found at ttps://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/File:OSE_Marlin.zip


NOTES:

Note that D3D 1807 Marlin/OSE_Marlin does not have OSE_Marlin.ino file, whereas the other folder - OSE_Marlin - does have OSE_Marlin.ino. What gives?
